## ParseText
Parsetext is open source Optical Character Recognition(OCR) application for recognizing and processing Persian text. It provides precise text extraction, finely tuned to the unique characteristics of the Persian language.

### Overview
ParseText, in this version, focuses on recognizing word-level data from documented sources. This marks the beginning of a long journey toward building a comprehensive OCR solution for Persian text.

#### Future Vision
This project is in its early stages, but there are exciting plans to expand and enhance its capabilities. The roadmap includes:

- Text Detection: Implementing, fine-tuning, or integrating existing text detectors to accurately locate text regions in images before recognition.
- Outdoor Text Recognition: Enhancing the OCR model to detect and recognize outdoor texts such as traffic signs, market signs, and other environmental text.
- Sentence and Paragraph Recognition: Moving beyond word-level recognition to process complete textual structures.
Handling Complex Ligatures and Diacritics: Improved recognition of intricate aspects of Persian script.
- Real-Time OCR: Developing real-time OCR capabilities for dynamic image sources.
- NLP Integration: Incorporating context-aware text processing for semantic analysis.

Stay tuned as ParseText evolves to meet these goals and more!

## Usage

### Text Recognition
To recognize text from an image:
1. Testing model:
```
python test.py --imgdir <folder of images> --CRNN <path to model> --outputdir <dir to save result>
```
2. Use it in code:
```python
import text_recognizer
from PIL import Image

with open("char_to_index.json", 'r',  encoding="utf-8") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    char2index = data["char_to_index"]

tr = text_recognizer.TextRecognizer(model_path= "path_to_pretrained_model", char_index=char2index
                                    , device="cuda_or_cpu")
# Feed list of PIL images in list to model
img = Image.open("file_path")
result = tr.inference(images =[img])
```
### Training:
To train the model on a custom dataset:
```
python train.py --traindf <dir to train df> --testdf <dir to test df> 
```
For detailed information about the training options, check the docstrings in train.py. These options allow you to:

- Customize the learning rate, batch size, and optimizer settings.
- Select or switch between different architectures or loss functions.
- Specify checkpoints, evaluation frequency, and logging preferences
- Enable data augmentation and preprocessing techniques.

With these configurations, you can adapt the training process to meet your projectâ€™s specific requirements.
